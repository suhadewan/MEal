# MEal

MEal is an app made through Android Studio and was
created to help people who struggle to plan 
their meals or think of ideas for things to cook. 
Currently, only some of the front-end of the app 
is finished. When complete, the app should be able
to allow the user to login, save their ingredients
and items in their kitchen into the app, and get
recipes based on the things that they have. They
should also be able to use the calendar feature to
do weekly meal preps and the reward system that we
plan to implement will help motivate them to make
their meals. We plan to use this API: 
https://serpapi.com/recipes-results 
to search for the recipes based on the things that the
user inputted. 

For more information about the plans for our app and
the design, please check out our prototype here:
