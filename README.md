# MEal

MEal is an app made through Android Studio. 
It is an app to help people who struggle to plan 
their meals or think of ideas for things to cook. 
Currently, only some of the front-end of the app 
is complete. When complete, the app should be able
to allow the user to login, save their ingredients
and items in their kitchen into the app, and get
recipes based on the things that they have. We plan
to use this API: https://serpapi.com/recipes-results 
to search for the recipes based on the things the
user inputted. 

For more information about the plans for our app and
the design, please check out our prototype here:
